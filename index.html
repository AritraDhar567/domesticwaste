         <div class="text">Domestic waste is a growing problem that has serious consequences for the environment. As our population grows and  consumption patterns change, we are generating more waste than ever before. This waste ends up in landfills, where it can take  hundreds of years to decompose and release harmful gases into the atmosphere. <br>
            In addition to the environmental impact, domestic waste also poses health hazards and depletes natural resources. Improper disposal of hazardous waste can lead to contamination of soil and water sources, while the extraction of raw materials for consumer goods contributes to deforestation and other forms of habitat destruction </div>
         <div class="headq">The Need for a Solution</div>
          <div class="text">Domestic waste has serious consequences on the environment, including pollution, health hazards, and depletion of natural resources.
            Pollution is one of the most significant consequences of domestic waste. When waste is not properly disposed of, it can contaminate the air, water, and soil. This contamination can lead to a variety of health problems for both humans and animals, including respiratory illnesses, cancers, and reproductive issues. Additionally, domestic waste can contribute to climate change by releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

         <div class="headq">Importance of waste management in
         keeping the environment clean</div>
         <div class="text">Recycling and Re-use: <hr>

            Waste management allows the re-use of things we consider as garbage. It helps us meet our needs while also ensuring that the environment isn’t exploited again and again.
            
            Recycling also gives people new ways to earn. It opens up business opportunities. <br> <hr>
            
            Health: <hr> 
            
            Accumulating and storing garbage for a very long time can emit toxic chemicals that can adversely affect one’s health. Exposure to such waste can make a person develop skin irritations, growth problems, reproductive problems, respiratory problems, and blood infections.
            
            Waste Management helps reduce these hazardous diseases and illnesses. It also improves public and community health conditions as it improves sanitation, removes breeding ground for mosquitoes, and reduces air pollution through waste burning. <br> <hr>
            
            Climate Change: <hr>
            
            Many industries dispose of effluents and smoke directly into the environment without filtering or treating it. Sometimes people burn their trash as a way of discarding it. All these activities lead to increased greenhouse gas production that causes global warming and affects the ozone layer.
            
            Proper Waste Management uses different types of techniques such as incinerators, filters, and liners to make sure that these toxic chemicals get separated from smoke and effluents and stop them from entering the atmosphere. <br> <hr>
            
            Make money: <hr>
            
            From a business point of view, if you live in an area where there are piles and heaps of garbage, you can form a community of some people for your waste collection business. Residents and several companies are willing to pay someone who can get rid of their wastes. Moreover, you can recycle garbage and make useful products, and then resell them; This will help not only in cleaning your cities but can also be a major step in restoring the greenery of our planet.</div>

                <ul style="list-style:square;">
                          <li>Region specific planning:  Every region has a different structure. Hence all the
                            activities should be planned & implemented on regional basis looking at the geographical, topographical and
                            cultural diversity of the country. 
                            </li>
                        <li>Planning from below: To make Solid Waste Management a success in true
                            sense, the planning as well as implementation should start from general
                            public level planning followed by block level planning, district level
                            planning and state level planning.</li>
                            <li>Involvement of self help groups, youth groups and small entrepreneurs:
                                The general public level waste management units can be run by self help
                                groups, youth groups or small entrepreneurs. This will help in making the
                                programme self supportive and sustainable.</li>
                                <li>Well planned and effective training policy: Technical training at all levels
                                    General public to state forms the backbone of a successful waste
                                    management programme. Adequate training must be given to all those
                                    concerned prior to actual launching of the programme in the field.

                                                 One of the most effective ways to manage electronic waste is through recycling. When electronics are recycled, valuable materials such as gold, silver, and copper can be extracted and reused in new products. This not only reduces the amount of waste in landfills, but also conserves natural resources and reduces the environmental impact of  mining. <hr> <br>
                                                 <img src="./assets/6. e waste management/ybPWS06tpYx0oWAaBD8M.png" alt="" id="ewaste2">
                                                 Another strategy is refurbishing. Refurbished electronics are devices that have been repaired or restored to their original condition, making them usable once again. By refurbishing electronics, we can extend their lifespan and reduce the need for new devices to be manufactured. This helps to conserve resources and reduce the amount of e-waste. <hr> <br>
                                                 Finally, responsible disposal is crucial for managing e-waste. This involves ensuring that electronics are disposed of in an environmentally friendly way, such as through certified e-waste recycling programs or donation to organizations that can make use of them. By disposing of electronics responsibly, we can prevent them from ending up in landfills where they can release harmful chemicals into the environment.

                                                One effective strategy for liquid waste management is to implement a treatment system. This involves using physical, chemical or biological processes to remove contaminants from the waste before it is discharged into the environment. Treatment methods can include sedimentation, filtration, and disinfection. <hr><br>
                                                Another strategy is to properly dispose of the treated waste. This can involve land application, where the treated waste is used as fertilizer for crops, or injection wells, where the waste is injected deep into the ground. It is important to choose a disposal method that is safe for both human health and the environment.

                                                Recycling is one of the most effective ways to manage plastic waste. By collecting and processing used plastics, we can turn them into new products and reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills or oceans. <hr> <br>
                                                Another solution is to reduce our use of single-use plastics, such as straws, bags, and utensils. This can be achieved by using reusable alternatives, like metal straws or cloth bags, or by choosing products with minimal packaging. <hr><br>
                                                Finally, implementing better waste management systems, such as composting and incineration, can help divert plastic waste from landfills and reduce its impact on the environment.

                                            <div class="text" id="hovertext">One of the most efficient and common ways to deal with metal scraps is to sell them to another company and treat scrap metal as a revenue source. The following advice is helpful when choosing a metal recycler:

                                                    <li>Know the current market price so that your business gets a fair return</li>
                                                    <li>Ensure that recyclers provide complete records of all transactions with your business</li>
                                                    <li>Confirm that recyclers use  metal analysis equipment such as a spectrometer to verify the type and grading of metal(s) being recycled</li>
                                                </ul> <br>
                                                Reduce your metal waste by purchasing products with less packaging or by choosing reusable alternatives. For example, using a refillable water bottle instead of buying single-use plastic bottles can greatly reduce your metal waste. <br>

                                            As individuals, we all have a role to play in reducing domestic waste and protecting the environment. One of the most important things we can do is to reduce our consumption of single-use products, such as plastic bags, straws, and water bottles. By opting for reusable alternatives, we can significantly reduce the amount of waste we generate.

                                                Effective waste management has numerous    benefits for both the environment and human health. One of the most significant benefits is a cleaner environment, which can lead to improved air and water quality. This is because properly managed waste reduces the amount of pollutants that can seep into the soil and waterways. Additionally, effective waste management can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. <br> <hr>
                                                Another important benefit of effective waste management is improved public health. Poorly managed waste can lead to health hazards such as the spread of diseases and pests, as well as exposure to hazardous chemicals. By managing waste properly, we can prevent these health risks and create a safer living environment for ourselves and future generations.
